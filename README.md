# Listen to this

Mod 3 final solo project at Turing.  

## Abstract: 
*Listen to this* is an app using [The Podcast API](https://www.listennotes.com/api/). This app allows user to search podcasts via keywords that they desire, get a list of podcasts, get additional details on that podcast and add them to 'listen to' list. This app doesn't try to solve any existing issue, it just had a simple purpose - encourage the user to find new podcasts to listen to, and hopefully continue the learning process.
